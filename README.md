# Rusty Micros

Welcome to `rusty-micros`! This project is a space where I’m exploring Rust alongside cloud technologies and software design practices. With a solid programming background and a growing interest in Rust, I’m working to create and improve components that align with modern development approaches.

## Project Overview

`rusty-micros` is an evolving project aimed at experimenting with Rust in the context of cloud computing and microservices. The goal is to apply practical software design patterns and development practices, while allowing the content and structure to grow and adapt as I learn and refine my skills.
